    <h2>Supporting Students Through Peer Leadership</h2>
    <p>
      Adjusting to a new academic system and cultural environment can be
      challenging. The Peer Support Network connects incoming international
      students with experienced senior students at KCGI to provide guidance,
      encouragement, and practical support.

    <h3>🤝 How the Peer Support Network Works</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Senior Student Mentors</strong><br>
        Volunteer senior students share their experiences and provide guidance
        on academic expectations, campus systems, and daily life in Japan.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Academic and Daily Life Support</strong><br>
        New students can ask questions about classes, assignments, transportation,
        housing, and cultural adjustment in a friendly, non-judgmental setting.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Leadership Development</strong><br>
        Mentors strengthen leadership, communication, and problem-solving skills
        while actively contributing to student well-being and campus inclusion.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Building Community</strong><br>
        The program encourages cooperation, empathy, and cross-cultural
        understanding among students from diverse backgrounds.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🌱 Why Peer Support Matters</h3>
    <p>
      Peer-to-peer guidance helps reduce isolation, builds confidence, and
      creates a stronger sense of belonging. By supporting one another, students
      develop a more connected and inclusive learning environment at KCGI.
