  <h2>Supporting Each Other</h2>

  <p>
    Adjusting to a new country can be stressful. The peer support network
    connects new international students with senior students who can offer
    guidance and emotional support.
  </p>

  <h3>How Peer Support Works</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Senior students volunteer as mentors</li>
    <li>New students can ask questions freely</li>
    <li>Support includes academics, daily life, and cultural adjustment</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Leadership and Community</h3>
  <p>
    This initiative encourages leadership, empathy, and cooperation within the
    KCGI international student community.
