  <h2>Important Administrative Information</h2>

  <h3>Residence Card</h3>
  <p>
    International students must always carry their residence card. Any change
    in address should be reported to the local city office.
  </p>

  <h3>Visa Renewal</h3>
  <p>
    Students should start the visa renewal process well before the expiration
    date. Required documents may include enrollment certificates and academic
    records.
  </p>

  <h3>City Office Procedures</h3>
  <p>
    Many procedures such as health insurance registration and address changes
    are handled at the city office. Staff may not always speak English, so
    preparation is important.
