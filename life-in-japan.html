  <h2>Daily Life Essentials</h2>

  <h3>Housing</h3>
  <p>
    Finding accommodation in Japan can be challenging due to language and
    contract requirements. Students should carefully check rent, utilities,
    and house rules before signing any agreement.
  </p>

  <h3>Transportation</h3>
  <p>
    Public transportation is reliable and widely used in Japan. Students are
    encouraged to use IC cards such as Suica or Pasmo for trains and buses.
  </p>

  <h3>Shopping and Daily Needs</h3>
  <p>
    Convenience stores, supermarkets, and 100-yen shops are common and provide
    affordable daily necessities. Learning basic Japanese phrases can be very
    helpful.
