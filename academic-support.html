  <h2>Understanding Academic Culture</h2>

  <p>
    Academic communication in Japan may feel different for international
    students. Respect, punctuality, and clear communication are highly valued.
  </p>

  <h3>Class Participation</h3>
  <p>
    Students are expected to attend classes regularly, participate in
    discussions, and complete assignments on time.
  </p>

  <h3>Group Work</h3>
  <p>
    Group projects are common. Clear communication, responsibility, and mutual
    respect are essential for successful collaboration.
  </p>

  <h3>Communication with Faculty</h3>
  <p>
    Emails should be polite and clear. If students are unsure, they are
    encouraged to ask questions rather than stay silent.
